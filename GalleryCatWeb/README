Configuration:

Set your galleries' base_path in galleries.conf to an absolute path. This can
probably be made to work with relative URLs to skip this part for default
configs, but for now it only works when it's absolute.


By default galleries are in root/static/galleries - symlink your real gallery
directory there if you want Catalyst to serve them.
